    My grandparents are not your typical elderly. My grandpa, 10 or
    so years my grandma’s junior, is a husky man with a healthy
    beard and defined muscles. My darling grandmother is a frail
    woman with strong hands and and wispy hair. She’s been an artist
    since the 70’s, and struggled many years to reach her status.
    She became pregnant with my mother in the 60’s and her
    not-so-present husband, at the time, was usually stoned or
    probably drunk, sometimes both. This is not the same grandfather
    I love and know so well today, I’ve not met this man and neither
    has my mother, but my grandmother’s relationship with him is
    surprising, considering her mormon affiliation. “Peace on Earth”
    - Nancy Glazier My grandmother, named Nancy, always has a trick
    or two up her sleeve, and a garden of mysteries, cultivated with
    patience and wit, rather than a closet of skeletons.
    Occasionally, she will share some wisdom, with a gracious smile
    and twinkle in her eye. She does not share her strife easily,
    and more often than not, she cultivates her secrets in private.
    Despite this, she will believe in you wholeheartedly and to the
    fullest, not a sliver of doubt. This is a stark contrast to my
    grandfather’s sarcastic sensibility and practical goofiness.
    “Leap of Faith” - Nancy Glazier She sporadically tells me about
    how she once smoked cigarettes, or that she has a red rose inked
    on her butt to cover a birthmark. I’ll ask to see it and she
    will blush and saying, “some other time.” All this and more,
    which she caringly covers with flowy, ankle-length, island
    skirts called sulus, bought during the summer months in Fiji,
    when my grandparents used to own a house in Savusavu. Tropical
    map of Fiji acquired from fiji.travel website Nancy and Lee, my
    grandfather, usually reside in a one-story house atop a hill in
    the southern desert of Nevada. It is hot and arid, their house
    is surrounded by palms, dates, and pomegranates. “Latter-day
    Daniel” - Nancy Glazier Depicted is her husband Lee. My
    grandma’s art studio isn’t but 100 feet from the house, and my
    grandpa’s shooting range another 100 feet from that. Beyond the
    shooting range are the crusting edges of the state park, Valley
    of Fire, which I often lose myself in. “Itchy Spot” - Nancy
    Glazier I remember wandering the hillsides behind the studio as
    a child, finding treasures like fossils, and chunks of petrified
    wood, and selenite, if I was lucky. In the clean and dry air,
    after the sun had set, glowing scorpions revealed themselves
    from under their rocks in the sandy banks of the wash. Once my
    grandfather did so much as dare my younger sister Naomi, around
    10-years-old, to eat one. They went out to catch it and my
    saintly grandma boiled the poor sucker alive, then sniped it’s
    pincher off. She conjured up a frying pan and in a heap of
    butter, seasoned it with garlic and salt. She presented it
    caringly on a plate to Naomi who, with devilish confidence,
    swiftly gobbled it up, licking her fingers. “Mama’s girls” -
    Nancy Glazier Grandma’s sleight of hand in the kitchen was
    nothing to take lightly. This is not your typical cliche, it is
    not only her cookies that are delicious, though they are. She
    will cook something simple, say, a roasted chicken. Before this
    chicken reaches the table, it will draw hungry masses from all
    corners of the house. Spiders await on windowsills yearning for
    a taste. Ravenous family members stare from the edges of the
    kitchen, and more than once I’ve offered to help in the kitchen,
    just to sneak a scrap. My grandmother’s enchantment reaches
    farther than cookies and scorpions. She’s an artist by wright,
    and woefully strokes the canvas with her blood, sweat, and
    tears. “Canyon Moon”- Nancy Glazier She's put in thousands of
    hours, and procured tens of thousands of dollars for a single
    painting. She is a wildlife artist, all of her art is based off
    of photos she and my grandpa took themselves. She typically uses
    stretched canvas and oil paints. Nancy is very unique in that
    she taught herself how to paint with her left hand, and produces
    two individual styles of art. One bold and strong, with strong
    lines and strong color, abstract at birth. “Carousel Horses II ”
    - Nancy Glazier The other technique is more fine and delicate,
    like a mist, with realistic softness and tender details. She
    activates various parts of her brain and procures two uniquely,
    but still related works depending on the hand she uses to paint.
    “Eye of the Storm”- Nancy Glazier She’s dedicated her whole life
    to artistry and has quite the craft. My grandfather has told me
    he’s had to tear her away from her pieces many times, begging
    her to sleep and eat. She reluctantly obliges only to sneak away
    after he’s fallen asleep. He later told me that he believes she
    may have aspergers. She is hyper-sensitive and sees the world
    and colors differently than most people. My grandpa reminices,
    “We were driving down the road, her eyes wide and buggy, nose
    pressed to the window. “Lee!” she exclaims. Confused, he asks
    her “What?” “Look at the colors!” He peers over her through the
    window, amass a brown landscape of shrubbery and bush. “Look at
    the colors!” Nancy exclaims again, “Look at the purples and the
    oranges!” My grandpa did not see such colors, but he did see
    something else, a strangeness and childlikeness albeit her age.
    Her creativity shines through even still, without the slightest
    diminishing. Nancy is a lover of art, animals, and nature. Born
    in 1947, She resides in Nevada with her husband Lee and two
    dogs. Currently, she spends her time painting abstract realism
    and formulation recipes for alternative food companies. She is
    an active member in the LDS church and a naturalist at heart. On

    this morning, watering... Very few plants are surviving this
    heat wave! However, SWEET POTATO VINES just keep on keeping on –
    I call them " my heart of green" in this challenging climate!
    Also, and sadly, most of the plants are also being decimated by
    a congruent invasion of bugs .... But again .... sweet potato
    vines are holding their own. SWEET POTATO GREENS are little
    known in the U.S., but they are a popular staple in warmer
    countries... Super nutritious, mild flavored, very versatile ( A
    lot like spinach ) and quick cooking! As fast as you snap off a
    heart shaped leaf, a new shoot springs fourth where the old leaf
    grew. A cut-and-come-again friendly green! Here's a quick sketch
    came from this morning's visit to the garden. I allowed myself
    just a stub of vine charcoal, so that when the charcoal was done
    - so was I." (drawn on sanded pastel paper)"`,
